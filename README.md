# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
Welcome and thanks for stopping by!

I am buidling a data warehouse primarily with SQL server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.

This will be my first Data Engineering project and my objective is to build a SQL based DWH that will consiladte sales data, which will follow ETL processes for analytic reporting and better informed data decision-making.

## Specifications:
  - Data Sources: import from two sources(ERP and CRM) provided by CSV files.
  - Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
  - Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
  - Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of the data won't be necesarry.
  - Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## Objective:
Develop SQL-Based Analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
  - customer behavior
  - product performances
  - sale trends

## Audience
